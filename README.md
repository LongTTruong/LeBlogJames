# Hello!
Hey, this is Long. If you see this, you're either: a no good bot who is crawling github to steal api keys. Bad bot! :angry:
Oooor you're an actual person, in which case hello!

This project is just a little something that I started to:
    1. Practice some frontend stuff
    2. Get familiar with CMSs
    3. Learn how to deploy a website
    4. Have a place to put all my thoughts and ideas

If I'm still kicking about, which I'll presume is the case, you can send me an email at longtruong31@gmail.com or add me on Discord at "dobloys"

I'm always open to chat about anything, so don't be shy!
